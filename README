Regenerates Prebuilts
================================================================================
The following sections assume you have created a PetaLinux project with a
reference BSP and are your working directory is the root directory of the
PetaLinux project.

Software Images
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can run the following command to rebuild the software images:
 * zynq_fsbl.elf
 * image.ub
 * zImage
 * u-boot.elf
 * system.dtb
 $ petalinux-build

You can also rebuild some of the images alone as follows:
 * zynq_fsbl.elf
   $ petalinux-build -c bootloader

 * u-boot.elf
   $ petalinux-build -c u-boot

 * system.dtb
   $ petalinux-build -c device-tree

You can generate BOOT.BIN file with "petalinux-package --boot" command:
 $ petalinux-package --boot --fpga pre-built/linux/implementation/download.bit \
   --fsbl pre-built/linux/images/zynq_fsbl.elf \
   --u-boot=pre-built/linux/images/u-boot-s.bin

Hardware Images
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * download.bit
   The hardware project source files are in "hardware/" directory. You can
   open the hardware project with vivado, and rebuild it.
